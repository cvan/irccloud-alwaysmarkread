irccloud.AlwaysMarkRead.user.js
===============================

The default behavior of [IRCCloud.com](http://www.irccloud.com) is such that each channel has to be manually marked as read if the backlog exceeds what is currently visible in the window. This userscript addresses the problem by always marking a buffer read once activated by clicking.
